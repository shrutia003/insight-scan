"I used to love it, but they keep making minor changes that just make the app worse, especially as a free player. Recently, they removed move feedback from the free analysis, and they changed the undo button without an option to use the old method. I would recommend it if you want to play online with other players, but if you want to play computers offline, there are better apps out there unless you want to pay a subscription.",4.7,"December 5, 2024",used love keep making minor change make app worse especially free player recently removed move feedback free analysis changed undo button without option use old method would recommend want play online player want play computer offline better apps unless want pay subscription,positive,positive
"Great app but buggy. The review always bugd out and stops working forcing me to redo it. Also, why if your moves are already premoved does it take up time? Ill premove 4 moves ahead and each time itll take up half a second or more. Whats the point in pre moving? Pls fix these issues. Also, add more time before disconnecting a player if his internet cuts out. Ive lost a ton of games bc of my internet cutting out for a minute.",3.0,"November 18, 2024",great app buggy review always bugd stop working forcing redo also move already premoved take time ill premove 4 move ahead time itll take half second whats point pre moving pls fix issue also add time disconnecting player internet cut ive lost ton game bc internet cutting minute,neutral,neutral

"This app has helped me Seriously elevate my chess game. It's changed how I see the game by so much. Small critique, though: The puzzle points system, I don't feel it's entirely accurate. A lot puzzles I get wrong, I end up getting right after the 2nd, 3rd, 4th or even 5th try. That has to count for something, right? There should be some way of being able to earn at least just a few points if a person manages to solve a puzzle after multiple tries(without any help, of course).",1.0,"October 1, 2024",app helped seriously elevate chess game changed see game much small critique though puzzle point system dont feel entirely accurate lot puzzle get wrong end getting right 2nd 3rd 4th even 5th try count something right way able earn least point person manages solve puzzle multiple trieswithout help course,negative,negative
"What happened to game reviews?! The new version is awful. Absolutely horrible experience, and it's so jarring to use it now. Wish I could install the old version. Smh. Puzzles are also still really buggy and often freeze (every 3-4 puzzles). I do puzzles way more than games, so it's a huge issue for me. Paying 120/yr, I expected better. I cancelled premium and wow, the experience is absolutely awful as a free user. Goodbye.

"Price point far too high, discouraging new players who would like to learn from playing at all. Update: After literally dozens of *documented* losses due to running out of time while still having time on the clock, I have attempted to get support for the issue. After literally 15 minutes of fighting with a bot, I was able to get a prompt for a human to assist. IN 3 DAYS. An app with no support, a flawed clock, and a pricepoint so high absolutely should not be allowed on any app store.",2.0,"November 30, 2024",price point far high discouraging new player would like learn playing update literally dozen documented loss due running time still time clock attempted get support issue literally 15 minute fighting bot able get prompt human assist 3 day app support flawed clock pricepoint high absolutely allowed app store,negative,negative
"Who's idea it was to remove the back and forth button while playing bots? That single feature change ruined my whole experience. I'm actually struggling to go back on the app and enjoy the game. I like to see how things evolve, and this makes it very hard and not fun at all. There are tons of online reviewers who also hate this feature passionately. It's very idiotic.",1.0,"November 23, 2024",who idea remove back forth button playing bot single feature change ruined whole experience im actually struggling go back app enjoy game like see thing evolve make hard fun ton online reviewer also hate feature passionately idiotic,negative,negative
"Used this app as a platinum subscriber for 2-3 years. In that time, the price has more than doubled, and now there's an even higher subscription tier necessary to be able to review games the way I could before this update. I like chess, and this has been a great app for it, but it's gotten too greedy for casuals. Either stay free and accept limited puzzles and manual reviews, or expect to be fleeced.",3.0,"October 17, 2024",used app platinum subscriber 23 year time price doubled there even higher subscription tier necessary able review game way could update like chess great app gotten greedy casuals either stay free accept limited puzzle manual review expect fleeced,neutral,negative
"Great app for playing chess, but the subscriptions are too expensive, they need to drop the upper tiers lower. Especially when you keep in mind that LiChess is offering some similar things but without the subscription. Was really bummed to see no deal for black friday, still hoping it maybe comes to fruition.",5.0,"November 25, 2024",great app playing chess subscription expensive need drop upper tier lower especially keep mind lichess offering similar thing without subscription really bummed see deal black friday still hoping maybe come fruition,positive,positive
"Hey guys, you must have hired new product team about a year or two ago. Let me tell you - I'm really frustrated by your attempts to increase engagement - ads, emails, app and in-app notifications (""do you want to solve a puzzle"" - blocking MY experience). I just want to play a game or two. I ALREADY PAY YOU YEARLY SUBSCRIPTION - and started doing so because I was really empathetic to the cause and your app. But recently I'm really considering to cancel my subscription.

I really enjoy the features and being able to play against real people but it's really frustrating when people keep abandoning games the moment I have the upper hand. I feel like it makes the experience sour and overall makes me feel frustrated that the app doesn't do more to mitigate this like freezing people accounts for 24 hours if the abandon more than 2 or more games in a row or SOMETHING idk.,1.0,"October 19, 2024",really enjoy feature able play real people really frustrating people keep abandoning game moment upper hand feel like make experience sour overall make feel frustrated app doesnt mitigate like freezing people account 24 hour abandon 2 game row something idk,negative,negative
"Why are app developers always making things worse with upgrades? This latest version sucks when using landscape mode. Why? I don't get it. Actually I have to give this just 1 star. I like the puzzles but now it's insanely annoying with ridiculous graphics and nonsense. Sorry to whoever likes to make animations. I can't even use it, it's so annoying.

"They do think this is the best chess app, but I am so absolutely tired of the ""vacation"" abuse. If you have an agreement per day and your opponent suddenly once more time, they just get to go on vacation for up to a month. This is done per move for some players. There should be a setting to match with others who chose to have this feature disabled or not. I will not subscribe for this exact reason.",2.0,"November 12, 2024",think best chess app absolutely tired vacation abuse agreement per day opponent suddenly time get go vacation month done per move player setting match others chose feature disabled subscribe exact reason,negative,negative
"There's no customer support. I have 2 email addresses, one I signed up with forever ago and I've I never signed up with. The app insists both have accounts, and will reset neither password when I try. They have completely replaced human help with a laughable AI chat bot, and I cannot talk to someone to fix this.

"I've been having extremely bad sound issues on this app. Repeatedly have tried to contact support, and nobody's doing anything. It's making me really mad, because im paying as a diamond member, and I take my chess very seriously. Everytime I contact support, they repeat the issue that I've been explaining.

The 700 beginner ai loses every game and plays dumb moves. The 1000 ai plays flawless and on your first mistake will take all of your important pieces. NOT good for chess unless you are already a master. As the learning curve is a paywall. Still no change after a year... I can beat 1200 and below 100% of the time but I have never beaten 1300 under any circumstance. Still not possible to beat 1300+AI... The AI doesn't force stalemate every game now.. it just cannot make mistake...,1.0,"November 2, 2024",700 beginner ai loses every game play dumb move 1000 ai play flawless first mistake take important piece good chess unless already master learning curve paywall still change year beat 1200 100 time never beaten 1300 circumstance still possible beat 1300ai ai doesnt force stalemate every game cannot make mistake,negative,negative
After multiple days of my account being hacked and reaching out to every resource at my disposal I've finally gotten my hijacked account back. I would make this 5 stars but the AI support is awful and the support email found on the main page doesn't work. The AI is not at all helpful for breached accounts and often runs in circles. Definitely something the staff should look into adding for the few of us who deal with such problems.,3.0,"October 11, 2024",multiple day account hacked reaching every resource disposal ive finally gotten hijacked account back would make 5 star ai support awful support email found main page doesnt work ai helpful breached account often run circle definitely something staff look adding u deal problem,neutral,neutral
"I've been using the app a while, and it's good. Does what it says. You can learn to play chess, play against bots and other people to improve your skills, puzzles, all that jazz. My one real gripe is how they changed the game review screen. I don't know if it's still there and I just can't find it, but I liked being able to go through move by move the way it was before the update. Now when you do it it just rushes through and only shows you like 3 moves at most with a random coach head up top.",1.0,"September 9, 2024",ive using app good say learn play chess play bot people improve skill puzzle jazz one real gripe changed game review screen dont know still cant find liked able go move move way update rush show like 3 move random coach head top,negative,negative
