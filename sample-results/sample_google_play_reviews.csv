"I used to love it, but they keep making minor changes that just make the app worse, especially as a free player. Recently, they removed move feedback from the free analysis, and they changed the undo button without an option to use the old method. I would recommend it if you want to play online with other players, but if you want to play computers offline, there are better apps out there unless you want to pay a subscription.",4.7,"December 5, 2024"
"Great app but buggy. The review always bugd out and stops working forcing me to redo it. Also, why if your moves are already premoved does it take up time? Ill premove 4 moves ahead and each time itll take up half a second or more. Whats the point in pre moving? Pls fix these issues. Also, add more time before disconnecting a player if his internet cuts out. Ive lost a ton of games bc of my internet cutting out for a minute.",3.0,"November 18, 2024"
Best chess game experience ever. Hands down. All of the puzzles. All of the lessons. All of the drills. All the live games from one minute bullet to five minute blitz and any other time controlled. play Daily games where if you want all you have to move is once a day or once every other day and many more days. Learn the basics all the way to G.M,2.0,"December 5, 2024"
"This app has helped me Seriously elevate my chess game. It's changed how I see the game by so much. Small critique, though: The puzzle points system, I don't feel it's entirely accurate. A lot puzzles I get wrong, I end up getting right after the 2nd, 3rd, 4th or even 5th try. That has to count for something, right? There should be some way of being able to earn at least just a few points if a person manages to solve a puzzle after multiple tries(without any help, of course).",1.0,"October 1, 2024"
"What happened to game reviews?! The new version is awful. Absolutely horrible experience, and it's so jarring to use it now. Wish I could install the old version. Smh. Puzzles are also still really buggy and often freeze (every 3-4 puzzles). I do puzzles way more than games, so it's a huge issue for me. Paying 120/yr, I expected better. I cancelled premium and wow, the experience is absolutely awful as a free user. Goodbye. Going back to ad-free Lichess now.",3.0,"October 31, 2024"
"Price point far too high, discouraging new players who would like to learn from playing at all. Update: After literally dozens of *documented* losses due to running out of time while still having time on the clock, I have attempted to get support for the issue. After literally 15 minutes of fighting with a bot, I was able to get a prompt for a human to assist. IN 3 DAYS. An app with no support, a flawed clock, and a pricepoint so high absolutely should not be allowed on any app store.",2.0,"November 30, 2024"
"Who's idea it was to remove the back and forth button while playing bots? That single feature change ruined my whole experience. I'm actually struggling to go back on the app and enjoy the game. I like to see how things evolve, and this makes it very hard and not fun at all. There are tons of online reviewers who also hate this feature passionately. It's very idiotic.",1.0,"November 23, 2024"
"Used this app as a platinum subscriber for 2-3 years. In that time, the price has more than doubled, and now there's an even higher subscription tier necessary to be able to review games the way I could before this update. I like chess, and this has been a great app for it, but it's gotten too greedy for casuals. Either stay free and accept limited puzzles and manual reviews, or expect to be fleeced.",3.0,"October 17, 2024"
"Great app for playing chess, but the subscriptions are too expensive, they need to drop the upper tiers lower. Especially when you keep in mind that LiChess is offering some similar things but without the subscription. Was really bummed to see no deal for black friday, still hoping it maybe comes to fruition.",5.0,"November 25, 2024"
"Hey guys, you must have hired new product team about a year or two ago. Let me tell you - I'm really frustrated by your attempts to increase engagement - ads, emails, app and in-app notifications (""do you want to solve a puzzle"" - blocking MY experience). I just want to play a game or two. I ALREADY PAY YOU YEARLY SUBSCRIPTION - and started doing so because I was really empathetic to the cause and your app. But recently I'm really considering to cancel my subscription. Think about it.",5.0,"November 3, 2024"
I really enjoy the features and being able to play against real people but it's really frustrating when people keep abandoning games the moment I have the upper hand. I feel like it makes the experience sour and overall makes me feel frustrated that the app doesn't do more to mitigate this like freezing people accounts for 24 hours if the abandon more than 2 or more games in a row or SOMETHING idk.,1.0,"October 19, 2024"
"Why are app developers always making things worse with upgrades? This latest version sucks when using landscape mode. Why? I don't get it. Actually I have to give this just 1 star. I like the puzzles but now it's insanely annoying with ridiculous graphics and nonsense. Sorry to whoever likes to make animations. I can't even use it, it's so annoying. I so loved doing chess puzzles.",1.0,"September 28, 2024"
"They do think this is the best chess app, but I am so absolutely tired of the ""vacation"" abuse. If you have an agreement per day and your opponent suddenly once more time, they just get to go on vacation for up to a month. This is done per move for some players. There should be a setting to match with others who chose to have this feature disabled or not. I will not subscribe for this exact reason.",2.0,"November 12, 2024"
"There's no customer support. I have 2 email addresses, one I signed up with forever ago and I've I never signed up with. The app insists both have accounts, and will reset neither password when I try. They have completely replaced human help with a laughable AI chat bot, and I cannot talk to someone to fix this. Wish I could know how the app works when I can use its features. Edit: in response to the reply to my review: If I type ""contact"" into the chat bot, it does NOT let me contact anyone.",2.0,"October 1, 2024"
"I've been having extremely bad sound issues on this app. Repeatedly have tried to contact support, and nobody's doing anything. It's making me really mad, because im paying as a diamond member, and I take my chess very seriously. Everytime I contact support, they repeat the issue that I've been explaining. I really feel like the FIDE needs to investigate this apps employment. Nobody's doing anything to help with the issue that I'm having. I've sent multiple complaints, and support is being weird",3.0,"November 5, 2024"
The 700 beginner ai loses every game and plays dumb moves. The 1000 ai plays flawless and on your first mistake will take all of your important pieces. NOT good for chess unless you are already a master. As the learning curve is a paywall. Still no change after a year... I can beat 1200 and below 100% of the time but I have never beaten 1300 under any circumstance. Still not possible to beat 1300+AI... The AI doesn't force stalemate every game now.. it just cannot make mistake...,1.0,"November 2, 2024"
After multiple days of my account being hacked and reaching out to every resource at my disposal I've finally gotten my hijacked account back. I would make this 5 stars but the AI support is awful and the support email found on the main page doesn't work. The AI is not at all helpful for breached accounts and often runs in circles. Definitely something the staff should look into adding for the few of us who deal with such problems.,3.0,"October 11, 2024"
"I've been using the app a while, and it's good. Does what it says. You can learn to play chess, play against bots and other people to improve your skills, puzzles, all that jazz. My one real gripe is how they changed the game review screen. I don't know if it's still there and I just can't find it, but I liked being able to go through move by move the way it was before the update. Now when you do it it just rushes through and only shows you like 3 moves at most with a random coach head up top.",1.0,"September 9, 2024"
