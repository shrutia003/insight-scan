### 1. Set Up Environment
Ensure you have Python installed and set up a virtual environment for dependency management.
Install libraries you'll need:
bash
Copy code
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 selenium pandas scikit-learn nltk

### 2. Automate Comment Extraction
GitHub: Use the GitHub API to pull issue comments, filtering by repository or issue type if needed.
Google Play Store and Apple App Store:
Use scraping libraries like Selenium to automate data extraction from these platforms, as official APIs might limit or lack reviews.
Data Storage: Store comments in a structured format (like a DataFrame) for easy manipulation during analysis.

### 3. Summarization with NLP
Apply basic NLP techniques to identify recurring themes in comments.
Use libraries such as nltk or spacy for preprocessing (e.g., tokenization, stop-word removal).
Consider using a simple algorithm (e.g., clustering similar comments) to group related feedback.

### 4. Set Up Initial Evaluation
For summarization, create a simple evaluation method (e.g., checking theme accuracy manually on a sample of comments).
